My name is So Sakaguchi, and I go by [Mokusou](www.hackerone.com/mokusou?type=user). I'm currently a web application security engineer, and also a part-time bug bounty hunter working with HackerOne.

I have been learning computer science since October 2021, when I met my mentor Justin aka rhynorater, and since then my interest has gradually shifted from French philosophy, which was my major in college, to computer science and hacking. My current interest is mainly in web/mobile application hacking and 0-day/CVE hunting via source code review.

Besides hacking, I love learning new things, including languages (English, French), philosophy, history, and theology, as well as playing volleyball and board games.
