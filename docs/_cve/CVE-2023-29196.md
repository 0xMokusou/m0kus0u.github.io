|Affected versions|stable <= 3.0.2; beta <= 3.1.0.beta3; tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta3|
|Vulnerability type|CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting|
|Description|This vulnerability is not exploitable on the default install of Discourse. A custom feature must be enabled for it to work at all, and the attacker’s payload must pass the CSP to be executed. However, if an attacker succeeds in embedding Javascript that does pass the CSP, it could result in session hijacking for any users that view the attacker’s post.|
|Status|fixed in stable >= 3.0.3; beta <= 3.1.0.beta4; tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta4|
